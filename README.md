# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project  
---

[Link to Github page]()

Welcome to my first milestone project on user centric front end development. For this project
I've created a mobile responsive all inclusive website for the band "The Monkeys". 

## UX
---

This website is for fans of the Monkees to catch up on news, see tour information, 
listen and watch their content and easily book the band for events. 

As a fan, I navigate to the website and see the home page that contains read news, 
I notice that bookings have become available due to the news and the alert bar up top. 
Then I can navigate to the "bookings" page and fill out a form to submit a request to book. 

As a fan who follows the bands tour, on every page of the site there is a static side
bar containing information about upcoming shows. 

### Features
---

- The footer contains a text input that allows users to sign up to a mailing listen
- The footer also has links to all social medias of the Monkees
- The Listen page contains 4 mp3 files of songs that are playable and controllable 
- The Watch page contains a Monkees music video which is playaable and controllable
- The Bookings page allows users to submit a form to request bookings from the band
- The alert bar on all pages links to the booking page
