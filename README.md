# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project  

Welcome to my first milestone project on user centric front end development. My assignment was to
create a website for the band, The Monkees! 

## Getting Started

My vison was to create a very minimal, simple to navigate website which was mobile first 
ready for ease of use in the modern world. 

A statement image of The Monkees takes up much of the screen real estate on arrival,
with an alert very top to promote event bookings. 

The bottom of the screen invites the user the scroll
down to discover news and upcoming shows. 

The footer contains an option for fans to sign up to The Monkees newsletter 
to receive regular updates on news and tours. This is then followed by links to 
social media. 

The home page theme which includes "upcoming shows" is constant accross all pages 
linked in the nav bar. The other pages of the site contain songs to listen to,
a music video to watch and a form for bookings.

### Lessons Learned

While working on the project using Bootstrap I thought everything I was doing was 
mobile first due to using `col-md-12` and the like. Little did I understand at the time 
that I'd forgotten to use any kind of `viewport`. When I thought I was close to the tail
end of my project,
I tested it on my phone and noticed everything was tiny. I was using Chrome developer tools
but was just sliding the inspecter from side to side instead of using the phone button option. 
`¯\_(ツ)_/¯` After discovering that I continued to optimze the site for different screen & phone sizes.
